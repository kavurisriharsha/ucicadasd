## Clue 2 (from Coords): QR Code

At the above coords, a QR code is put up on a tree which then [redirects](https://scanqr.to/5e8484a0) to a certain YouTube channel by the name 
```dXhlmUUnteGlYS5stzo=```

**This clue is yet to be deciphered.**


## Clue 3: Video 1

This clue has 3 different parts. Namely, the image, the description, and the title.

The image shows what looks like a lecture hall.

The description contains the following text:
```
64
ZmluZCB1cyBpbiB0aGUgY2xhc3Nyb29tIGJlbmVhdGggdGhlIGVhcnRoLCB3aGVyZSBhcnQgaGFzIGJlZW4gZHJpdmVuIGludG8gbWFkbmVzcw==
```
`64` here implies Base 64 encoding. When decoded, the string obtained reads as follows:
```
find us in the classroom beneath the earth, where art has been driven into madness
```

This was taken to indicate towards the Mandeville Basement. Taking the above 2 clues together, it was determined that the location is in fact MANDE B202.

The third part, the title itself, is also a base 64 encoded string which when decoded reads as follows:
```
c291dGgubXA0 -> south.mp4
```

The audio in this video is assumed to have no meaning. The "unencrypted" version of the same can be found under the media directory in this repository


## Clue 4: Clue in MANDE B202

The fourth clue was found in MANDE B202 based on the video(Image in media).

The string, when decoded as base 64, reads as follows:

```
V0UgQVdBSVQgWU9VIEFU -> WE AWAIT YOU AT
```

## Clue 5: Video 2

This clue, once again, has multiple parts. Namely, the video itself, the description, the title, characters that appear within the video, and potentially, the audio.

The image depicts a chair and what looks like a cart in the background.

The description reads as follows:
```
V
zhpzlpcyf
```
V is taken to be in reference to the vigenere cipher. 

The title reads as follows:
```
eiekb.zg4
```
This is also assumed to be a vigenere cipher.

The characters in the video hold the vigenere key.

This script, when deciphered, reads `run`.

Using `run` as the vigenere key, the following is decoded:
```
zhpzlpcyf -> incircles
eiekb.zg4 -> north.mp4
```

`north` and `incircles` was taken to be in reference to the Triton Track and Field Stadium. 

## Clue 6: Code at Track

At the track, the following text was found taped to a shed.
```
VEhFIELOVEVSUOVDVELPTiBXSEVSRQ -> THE INTERSECTION WHERE
```
This when concatenated with the previous phrase gives the current clue that reads `WE AWAIT YOU AT THE INTERSECTION WHERE`.
