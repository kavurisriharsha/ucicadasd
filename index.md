## Intial Clue: Coords

A number of clues containing the coordinates 

```
32° 53' 18.1752" N
117° 14' 12.5664" W
```
have been found at various spots across campus. These spots have been in close proximity to Inside Loop stops.

## Clue 2 (from Coords): QR Code

At the above coords, a QR code is put up on a tree which then [redirects](https://scanqr.to/5e8484a0) to a certain YouTube channel by the name 

```

```

**This clue is yet to be deciphered.**


## Clue 3: Video 1

This clue has 3 different parts. Namely, the image, the description, and the title.

The image shows what looks like a lecture hall.

The description contains the following text:
```
64
ZmluZCB1cyBpbiB0aGUgY2xhc3Nyb29tIGJlbmVhdGggdGhlIGVhcnRoLCB3aGVyZSBhcnQgaGFzIGJlZW4gZHJpdmVuIGludG8gbWFkbmVzcw==
```
`64` here implies Base 64 encoding. When decoded, the string obtained reads as follows:
```
find us in the classroom beneath the earth, where art has been driven into madness
```

This was taken to indicate towards the Mandeville Basement. Taking the above 2 clues together, it was determined that the location is in fact MANDE B202.

The third part, the title itself, is also a base 64 encoded string which when decoded reads as follows:
```
c291dGgubXA0 -> south.mp4
```

The audio in this video is assumed to have no meaning. The "unencrypted" version of the same can be found under the media directory in this repository


## Clue 4: Clue in MANDE B202

The fourth clue was found in MANDE B202 based on the video(Image in media).

The string, when decoded as base 64, reads as follows:

```
V0UgQVdBSVQgWU9VIEFU -> WE AWAIT YOU AT
```

## Clue 5: Video 2

This clue, once again, has multiple parts. Namely, the video itself, the description, the title, characters that appear within the video, and potentially, the audio.

The image depicts a chair and what looks like a cart in the background.

The description reads as follows:
```
V
zhpzlpcyf
```
V is taken to be in reference to the vigenere cipher. 

The title reads as follows:
```
eiekb.zg4
```
This is also assumed to be a vigenere cipher.

The characters in the video hold the vigenere key.

This script, when deciphered, reads `run`.

Using `run` as the vigenere key, the following is decoded:
```
zhpzlpcyf -> incircles
eiekb.zg4 -> north.mp4
```

`north` and `incircles` were taken to be in reference to the Triton Track and Field Stadium. 

## Clue 6: Code at Track

At the track, the following text was found taped to a shed.
```
VEhFIELOVEVSUOVDVELPTiBXSEVSRQ -> THE INTERSECTION WHERE
```
This when concatenated with the previous phrase gives the current clue that reads `WE AWAIT YOU AT THE INTERSECTION WHERE`.

## Clue 7: Video 3

This clue involves a video, similar to the previous ones. The description of the video contains the following:

```
NQTAXPFTQRAGDYMPZQEEQEEQQWFTQRADQZMYQARFTQRAGDZMYQE -> BEHOLDTHEFOURMADNESSESSEEKTHEFORENAMEOFTHEFOURNAMES
po.umvvusp,-vs.trpmtrt
qn.nrnpmn,-un.pqtvoro
pv.vssnmmo,-tr.nprmpp
qt.sotssnn,-noo.ppmvnqt
```

This can be decoded using the affine cipher. All the subsequent lines after the first can be translated to coordinates.

```
32.8099863,-96.7530757
41.151301,-81.3479252
39.9661002,-75.135033
47.6276611,-122.3309147
```

The video title is as follows:
```
b3Iucm5zcXV2byxybS51c29ybXZzdS55YnE
```
When decoded using base 64, and subsequently, affine, we get the following output:

```
b3Iucm5zcXV2byxybS51c29ybXZzdS55YnE -> cf.fbgeijc,fa.igcfajgi.mpe -> 25.5164892,50.86250968.mp4
```

This coordinate points to a street named `West meets East`.

The image in the background of the image is of particular interest as the angle is quite hard to achieve as the various search parties have found. **This remains an open clue.**

## Clue 8: Video 4

This video was posted and solved shortly thereafter. 

The title reads as follows: 
```
RGZjcm10IChYc3Jtdmh2IGtzcm9saGxrc2IpIC0+IEtscm1naCBsdSBnc3YgeGxua3poaC5uazQ
```

This when decrypted using base 64 and subsequently affine cipher yields the following:

```
Dfcrmt (Xsrmvhv ksrolhlksb) -> Klrmgh lu gsv xlnkzhh.nk4

Wuxing (CHinese philosophy) -> Points of the compass.mp4
```

Similarly, the description reads as follows: 
```
TnJ3a2xybWcKS3pmbyBCbGZvbyAtPiBUc2ZvLCBMbnptCkR2eXl2dyAtPiBYc2lyaGdsa3N2aSBVbGhndmkgKHZ4bG1sbnJoZyk
```

Decrypting it yields the following:

```
Midpoint
Paul Youll -> Ghul, Oman
Webbed -> Christopher Foster (economist)
```

Taking these to be Wikipedia articles, a midpoint can be found as follows:

A shattered car door was spotted in Warren Canyon. At this location, another clue was found.

This when decrypted reads `YOUR JOURNEY CROSS`.
